#### I've stopped my learning almost one month! What my lazyness! I beg pardon to myself of future. Today I learnt async and await. I will finish up this up to tomorrow!!

Dec.23.2018
-----------
#### Repeated lesson from Class to Module. It seems that I don't understand its flexibility perfectly. Hopefully I get a sense of it in real project.
<br>


Dec.21.2018
-----------
#### Completed jQuery and its project assignment. I got a hunch in jQuery and its convenience. But why it was said that is cliche these days? I may know this when I master React?
<br>


Dec.20.2018
-----------
#### Made some interactive websites using jQuery. Jquery seems very convenient and easy to use! (This is beginner's misunderstood?). Well I worry that I might forget about DOM lessons I learnt prior to jQuery classes because of jQuery's good things.
<br>


Dec.19.2018
-----------
#### Completed 3pages of website using handleBar.js. It is not quite dynamic, but good to know advantage of DOM and handleBars. Also started jQuery looking helpful to make interactive JavaScript structure simpler!
<br>


Dec.16.2018
-----------
#### Finished the DOM class and just got into DOM project through Codecademy. Because curriculum is too simple, I felt I just learnt tickle of DOM structures. I need to learn it more through my own project or other courses.
<br>


Dec.14.2018
-----------
#### Completed my first game making project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with DOM! It wasn't difficult because I was helped by helping videos honestly. However this experience will be my big step for being a developer definitely! While I was making the game, I, once more, felt the programming is very sensitive for variable names!!! It doesn't work if there is typo or misword!!! Ughhhhhhhh!
<br>


Dec.13.2018
-----------
#### Make my first game using DOM structures. Code is very simple, but its dynamics seems unlimited!
<br>


Dec.11.2018
-----------
#### Practiced Javascript on how to make interactive website liking between HTML and JavaScipt. This is very basic course, but very useful course to make websites.
<br>


Dec.07 2018
-----------
#### Produced some webpage model using CSS Flex and Grid together. Seemed it's not clear when used display: flex; screen became unordered and messy. Need to go back to the last lesson or project of flex classes. Also get into DOM classes today. Looked similar to basic HTML structure. Need to explore more tomorrow.
<br>


Nov.30 2018
-----------
#### Finished CSS Flex class and making a page of project introduced by Codecademy. A concept of both Flex and Grid is not clear yet, but I felt it is essential to layout a page of websites. Once I finished this project, I need to explore this concept by making my own website.
<br>

Nov.29 2018
-----------
#### Mastered responsive design of CSS in Codecademy. very fascinating at dynamic change as browser's size change. Paralled with freeCodeCamp to enhance comprehension. Tomorrow will dive in Flex design.
<br>

Nov.27 2018
-----------
#### Learned git display including Grid and git basic design such as color and typography. Hopefully will be ready for building basic website after tomorrow.
<br>

Nov.25 2018
-----------
#### Revisited HTML / CSS classes in Codecademy in order to perform real project. Built one basic website using HTML, CSS syntas(see myLearningLog/Codecademy/CSS/css_project_dasmoto/). Finished all HTML courses and on the middle of CSS box model classes. Look forward to completing all CSS classes tomorrow.
<br>

Nov.24 2018
-----------
#### Completed Git / Github class in Codecademy. Learnt how to add, commit and push to my github repository. Also, learnt how manage branch and collaborate with my peer through git. git push requires specific setting and understanding. It is necessary to get familiar with this version control system.
<br>

Nov.22 2018
-----------
#### Finished Command line class in Codecademy. There should more numerous commands which I haven't learnt, I have enough skills to link between programming language and my computer.
<br>

Sep.01 2018 ~ Nov.14 2018
-----------
#### I have learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript in Codecademy. Those learning is related to fundamental syntaxs yet, I have tried to catch the gut of program languages and it have worked.
